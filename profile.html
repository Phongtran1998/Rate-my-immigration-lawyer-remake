			<p>Me and my wife had been paying different lawyers for several years for promises they could not keep. We finally were Introduced to John Smith and from there on He told us what to expect and what would more likely happened He didn't fill us with false hope and did an outstanding job on our case. I can't thank him enough for all the work she put in on our case.</p>
